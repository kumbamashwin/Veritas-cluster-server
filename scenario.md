Here are some **Business As Usual (BAU)** scenario-based questions for **Veritas Cluster Server (VCS)**. These scenarios involve typical day-to-day operations, troubleshooting, and administration tasks that you might encounter in a production environment.

### 1. **Service Group Failover Testing**
**Scenario**: The team wants to test whether the failover functionality of a service group is working properly. As part of the regular maintenance cycle, you're asked to trigger a failover of a service group from the primary node to the secondary node.

- **Question**: How would you manually failover a service group in Veritas Cluster Server from the primary node to a secondary node?
  
- **Answer**:
  You can use the `hagrp` command to failover the service group:
  ```bash
  hagrp -switch <service_group> -to <target_node>
  ```

  Example:
  ```bash
  hagrp -switch web_sg -to node2
  ```

  This will move the `web_sg` service group from the current node to `node2`.

### 2. **Resource Fault and Recovery**
**Scenario**: One of the resources in a service group has faulted, causing the service group to go offline. You need to troubleshoot and bring the service group back online.

- **Question**: How would you troubleshoot and recover from a resource fault in Veritas Cluster Server?

- **Answer**:
  1. Check the resource state using `hares` command:
     ```bash
     hares -state <resource_name>
     ```

  2. Examine the detailed logs for the resource to identify the fault cause:
     ```bash
     hamsg <resource_name>
     ```

  3. After resolving the issue (e.g., fixing the network, disk, or service), clear the fault state:
     ```bash
     hares -clear <resource_name> -sys <node_name>
     ```

  4. Bring the service group online:
     ```bash
     hagrp -online <service_group> -sys <node_name>
     ```

### 3. **Adding a New Node to the Cluster**
**Scenario**: Due to increasing resource demands, you're tasked with adding a new node to the existing Veritas Cluster.

- **Question**: What are the steps required to add a new node to an existing Veritas Cluster?

- **Answer**:
  1. Install the necessary VCS packages on the new node.
  2. Configure the network and storage similar to the existing nodes.
  3. Use `vxdctl` to check for the disk groups:
     ```bash
     vxdctl mode
     ```
  4. Add the node to the cluster using the following command on an existing node:
     ```bash
     /opt/VRTSvcs/bin/hasys -add <new_node>
     ```
  5. Synchronize the cluster configuration:
     ```bash
     hacf -verify /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config
     ```
  6. Check the status of the cluster to ensure the new node has been added:
     ```bash
     hasys -state
     ```

### 4. **Freezing a Service Group for Maintenance**
**Scenario**: You are planning to perform maintenance on a service group and need to ensure that VCS does not automatically failover or restart resources during the maintenance period.

- **Question**: How would you freeze a service group in Veritas Cluster Server for maintenance purposes?

- **Answer**:
  To freeze a service group and prevent failover, use the `hagrp` command:
  ```bash
  hagrp -freeze <service_group> -persistent
  ```

  After maintenance is complete, unfreeze the service group:
  ```bash
  hagrp -unfreeze <service_group>
  ```

### 5. **Node Failure Handling**
**Scenario**: One of the nodes in your VCS cluster unexpectedly fails. The services need to be moved to another available node.

- **Question**: How does Veritas Cluster Server handle node failure, and how can you verify that the failover occurred correctly?

- **Answer**:
  When a node failure is detected, VCS will automatically failover the service groups to an available node based on the service group failover policy.

  To verify that the failover occurred correctly:
  1. Check the status of the service groups:
     ```bash
     hagrp -state
     ```

  2. Verify the logs for any issues:
     ```bash
     hastatus -sum
     ```

  3. After resolving the issue with the failed node, bring it back into the cluster:
     ```bash
     hasys -state <failed_node>
     ```

### 6. **Resource Online/Offline Control**
**Scenario**: A specific resource in a service group needs to be manually taken offline for testing purposes, but the rest of the service group should remain online.

- **Question**: How do you take a specific resource offline without affecting the other resources in the service group?

- **Answer**:
  Use the `hares` command to take the resource offline:
  ```bash
  hares -offline <resource_name> -sys <node_name>
  ```

  After testing, you can bring the resource back online:
  ```bash
  hares -online <resource_name> -sys <node_name>
  ```

### 7. **Service Group AutoStart Configuration**
**Scenario**: You have a service group that should automatically start on a specific node when the node boots up. The service group is not starting as expected.

- **Question**: How do you configure a service group to automatically start on a specific node during boot?

- **Answer**:
  1. Ensure the `AutoStartList` attribute for the service group is configured to include the target node. You can set it using:
     ```bash
     hagrp -modify <service_group> AutoStartList <node_name>
     ```

  2. Verify that the service group is set to auto-start:
     ```bash
     hagrp -display <service_group> | grep AutoStart
     ```

  3. If necessary, modify the `AutoStart` attribute:
     ```bash
     hagrp -modify <service_group> AutoStart 1
     ```

### 8. **Network Failure Scenario**
**Scenario**: The network interface for one of the nodes in the cluster has failed, and the service groups are failing over to the other node. You need to investigate the failure.

- **Question**: How would you troubleshoot a network interface failure and prevent unnecessary failovers?

- **Answer**:
  1. Verify the network status using `ifconfig` or `ip` commands.
  2. Check the VCS logs for network-related failures:
     ```bash
     tail -f /var/VRTSvcs/log/engine_A.log
     ```

  3. Investigate the network resource status using the `hares` command:
     ```bash
     hares -state <network_resource_name>
     ```

  4. After fixing the issue, clear the faulted network resource and bring it back online:
     ```bash
     hares -clear <network_resource_name> -sys <node_name>
     hares -online <network_resource_name> -sys <node_name>
     ```

These scenarios cover typical **BAU tasks** and common challenges encountered in managing Veritas Cluster Server (VCS) environments. Each scenario provides insights into the commands and procedures necessary for maintaining cluster health and ensuring high availability of services.
To troubleshoot **service group failover issues** in a Veritas Cluster Server (VCS) on Linux, follow these detailed steps:

### **Problem**: Service group does not fail over to a secondary node.

### **Troubleshooting Steps**:

---

#### 1. **Check the Status of the Service Group**
   - First, verify the state of the service group and its resources on both nodes:
     ```bash
     hagrp -state <service_group_name>
     ```
   - Look for the current status (`ONLINE`, `OFFLINE`, `FAULTED`) on each node.

---

#### 2. **Check Resource Dependencies**
   - Sometimes, failover issues occur due to incorrect resource dependencies. To list the resource dependencies for the service group, use:
     ```bash
     hagrp -dep <service_group_name>
     ```
   - Ensure that all required resources are correctly configured and dependencies are met on the secondary node.

---

#### 3. **Verify Resource States**
   - Check the state of individual resources within the service group:
     ```bash
     hares -state
     ```
   - If a resource is in a "FAULTED" state, you need to troubleshoot and clear the fault before a failover can succeed.

---

#### 4. **Test Failover Manually**
   - If there are no immediate errors, manually attempt to fail over the service group to the secondary node:
     ```bash
     hagrp -switch <service_group_name> -to <node_name>
     ```
   - Check the logs in `/var/VRTSvcs/log/engine_A.log` or `engine_B.log` for any errors during the failover process.

---

#### 5. **Check Heartbeat Network**
   - VCS uses heartbeats to communicate between nodes. If the heartbeat fails, the cluster might not detect the node failure correctly.
   - To verify heartbeat communication, check the status of GAB and LLT:
     - GAB (Global Atomic Broadcast):
       ```bash
       gabconfig -a
       ```
       You should see an output showing membership information. Look for a letter "a" indicating that all nodes are communicating.
     - LLT (Low Latency Transport):
       ```bash
       lltstat -nvv
       ```
       This will show if nodes are communicating over the heartbeat networks.

---

#### 6. **Investigate Fencing Issues**
   - If the service group isn't failing over because of fencing issues (e.g., in a split-brain scenario), check the status of fencing:
     ```bash
     vxfenadm -d
     ```
   - Ensure fencing is configured correctly. If fencing misbehaves, VCS will not allow the service group to fail over to avoid data corruption.

---

#### 7. **Review Logs for Errors**
   - If the failover attempt failed, check the cluster logs for more specific details:
     - **Main VCS engine logs**:
       ```bash
       tail -f /var/VRTSvcs/log/engine_A.log
       ```
       This log will show cluster operations, including any errors related to the failover.
     - You can also check application-specific logs depending on what resources are involved.

---

#### 8. **Verify Service Group Failover Policies**
   - Check the service group failover policies to ensure that they are configured correctly:
     ```bash
     hagrp -display <service_group_name>
     ```
   - Look for attributes like `AutoFailOver`, `FailOverPolicy`, and `Critical`. Ensure that these are set according to your cluster design.

---

#### 9. **Ensure All Required Resources Are Online**
   - If some resources (like shared disks or networks) are not online on the secondary node, the failover will fail. Check resource states using:
     ```bash
     hares -state
     ```

---

#### 10. **Clear Faults in the Service Group**
   - If any resource or service group is faulted, it might prevent failover. Clear any faults before retrying the failover:
     ```bash
     hagrp -clear <service_group_name> -sys <node_name>
     ```
     If a specific resource is faulted, clear the resource fault:
     ```bash
     hares -clear <resource_name> -sys <node_name>
     ```

---

#### 11. **Check Cluster Freeze**
   - Ensure that the cluster or service group is not frozen, as a frozen state will prevent failover.
     ```bash
     hagrp -display <service_group_name> | grep -i frozen
     ```
   - If the service group is frozen, unfreeze it:
     ```bash
     hagrp -unfreeze <service_group_name> -persistent
     ```

---

### **Next Steps**
If the issue persists after performing these checks and tests, further investigation is needed. You may need to:

- Check the specific resource logs (e.g., application, network, or disk resources).
- Verify any recent changes in the cluster configuration or environment (e.g., patches or network changes).
- Review all nodes for system resource availability, ensuring that the secondary node is healthy and capable of running the service group.
